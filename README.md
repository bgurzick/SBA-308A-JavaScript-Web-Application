I tried fetching data to make a Mariners best form: top homerun hitter, top base stealer, top RBIs.
It never would seem to fetch the data right.

So I tried to just get the current American League Leaders and that didn't work right either.

So then I got the simple dogs API just to try to have something that worked. And it appeared to effectively fetch the data, but didn't initially work when I tried to tie it to the buttons.

Eventually, I got something good and functioning, but I had to sacrifice a few of the recommended requirements. Although, of note, our temp. instructor, Patrick, said: "For the SBA: only the GET requirement is necessary. POST, PATCH, PUT requirements have been eliminated."  So that helps a little.


Big lesson learned in this one, is to make sure my chosen API is functioning how I want (and is the info I want) BEFORE I run with a concept and start writing code.

Basically I had to burn everything down and start from scratch.  I wanted to do baseball, but we've got a couple of dog breeds instead.

UPDATE: added search functionality
