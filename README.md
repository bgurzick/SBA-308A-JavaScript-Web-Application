I tried fetching data to make a Mariners best form: top homerun hitter, top base stealer, top RBIs.
It never would seem to fetch the data right.

So I tried to just get the current American League Leaders and that didn't work right either.

So then I got the simple dogs API just to try to have something that worked. And it appeared to effectively fetch the data. But then it didn't work when I tried to tie it to the buttons.

Not totally sure what I'm doing wrong. But I've run out of time.
