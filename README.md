SBA-308A - JavaScript-Web-Application

-Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
-Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
-Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
-Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
-Organize files using modules and imports.

Big lesson learned in this one, is to make sure my chosen API is functioning how I want (and is the info I want) BEFORE I run with a concept and start writing code.

UPDATE: added search functionality
